# Welcome to the HPC Training Working Group

This working group started as a result of discussions at Supercomputing'23 and spans HPC centers both in academia and at national laboratories. The main goals for this working group are to:

- Share best practices, experiences, and ideas,
- Share upcoming user training and outreach events,
- Share collaboration opportunities (e.g., on training series),
- Share training materials (e.g., to avoid duplication), and
- Explore platforms for sharing with the broader community (e.g., [HPC-ED](https://hpc-ed.github.io/)).

## Get Involved

There are several ways you can get involved:

 - Join the Slack community
 - Participate in monthly meetings
 - Share your training events and materials
   
If you have any questions or would like to contribute, please feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/olcf/hpc-training-wg/issues) or send a
