# Welcome to the HPC Training Working Group

This working group started as a result of discussions at Supercomputing'23 and spans HPC centers both in academia and at national laboratories. The main goals for this working group are to:

1. Share best practices, experiences, and ideas,
1. Share upcoming user training and outreach events,
1. Share collaboration opportunities (e.g., on training series),
1. Share training materials (e.g., to avoid duplication), and
1. Explore platforms for sharing with the broader community (e.g., [HPC-ED](https://hpc-ed.github.io/), [SIGHPC Education Events Calendar](https://sighpceducation.acm.org/events/)).

## Get Involved

There are several ways you can get involved:

 - Add resources to the [Wiki](https://github.com/olcf/hpc-training-wg/wiki)
 - Participate in monthly meetings
 - Share your training events and materials
